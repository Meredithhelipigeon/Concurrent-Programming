a)
Rule 5: starvation will be broken.
This is because:
As we declare that turn=0, suppose h1 and h0 enters and declare the intetions at the same time.
h0 will go to the critical section since turn==0, while h1 is waiting in the busy loop "while (intent[you]) {}" Line.
h0 exits the critical section very quickly and then changes the intention to false very quickly. It goes back to line 
1 to declare the intention to true again quickly and at the same time, h1 doesnt notice that since its too quickly.
And turn==0 since line 4 hasn't been executed by h1 that changes the turn.

The scenario could repeat all the time, which causes the starvation of h1.


b)
This is because the above scenario requires one task moves very quickly from line 5, 6 and back to 1 "every" single
time it goes through the loop.
In a large program, the times it goes through the loop is big. And therefore, there might be one time that this task doesn't act quickly 
and other task could go to the critical section and the starvation will not happen.
