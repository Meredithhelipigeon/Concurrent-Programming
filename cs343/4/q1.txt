For this question, run "./q1 10000000 40" for all experiments

a)
NON-OPTIMIZED+ARRAY: 
1.23u 0.00s 0:01.23r 4720kb
Num of alloc calls: 34

NON-OPTIMIZED+STRING: 
99.50u 0.00s 1:39.63r 4780kb
Num of alloc calls: 800,000,041

NON-OPTIMIZED+STRSTREAM: 
87.38u 0.01s 1:30.46r 4724kb
Num of alloc calls: 37

OPTIMIZED+ARRAY: 
1.02u 0.00s 0:01.02r 4784kb
Num of alloc calls: 34

OPTIMIZED+STRING: 
80.06u 0.00s 1:20.14r 4736kb
Num of alloc calls: 800,000,041

OPTIMIZED+STRSTREAM: 
76.35u 0.00s 1:16.40r 4840kb
Num of alloc calls: 37

b)
ARRAY performs the best out of the three. STRING performs the worst and the time is about 100 times compared to the time that ARRAY uses.
STRSTREAM also performs pretty slow and the time is about 70 times compared to the time that ARRAY uses.

For the allocation, both STRING and STRSTREAM only uses ~30 calls but STRING uses 800,000,041 calls.

c)
Optimizing external resources leads to a significant improvement in user performance, with non-optimized resources performing at 
approximately 120% of the optimized level.

d)
This is probably because of the memory allocation.
ARRAY is internal and STRING/STRSTREAM is external. STRING/STRSTREAM has more malloc calls and external is more expensive and takes more time.
